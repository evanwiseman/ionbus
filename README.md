# IonBus

IonBus bridges the gap between **IoT devices** and **data infrastructure**. **IonBus** is a high-performance, lightweight IoT telemetry system designed to move data from distributed devices to backend services with speed and reliability.  
Built with **Go**, **MQTT**, **RabbitMQ**, and **PostgreSQL**, IonBus provides a flexible foundation for real-time sensor data ingestion, processing, and persistence.

## üí° Motivation
Pub/Sub architecture is fantastic at sending message(s) to many device(s) at once, yet this requires much technical knowhow and requires knowing which topics to subscribe to. The idea behind IonBus is:
-  Topics are adaptively configured from the server and sent downstream onto clients
-  Each topic can create a queue directly to RabbitMQ reducing latency and queue size
-  Data can be stored locally, publicly, or on a cloud provider for data persistence

This system emphasizes:
- **High throughput** with minimal overhead  
- **Reliable message delivery** and retry handling  
- **Extensible architecture** for analytics or monitoring
- **Developer-friendly design** for rapid iteration and testing

### Architecture Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Device Layer** | IoT or edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pis, sensors, or embedded clients) publish telemetry data such as temperature, humidity, or motion readings via **MQTT**. |
| **Local MQTT Broker** | A lightweight broker (e.g., **Mosquitto** or **EMQX**) running on-prem or edge devices that receives and routes telemetry messages with minimal latency. |
| **Bridge Service (MQTT ‚Üí RabbitMQ)** | A Go service that subscribes to MQTT topics and republishes messages to **RabbitMQ**. Provides decoupling, buffering, and reliable delivery to backend services. |
| **RabbitMQ Broker** | Acts as the **intermediary layer** between local ingestion and backend processing. Handles queueing, fanout, dead-lettering, and ensures messages are not lost. |
| **Processing Layer** | Backend workers (Go services) consume messages from RabbitMQ, trigger alerts or aggregate data for analytics. |
| **Storage Layer** | **PostgreSQL** or **TimescaleDB** stores processed telemetry for long-term query, reporting, and visualization. |
| **API / Visualization Layer** *(optional)* | Exposes REST or WebSocket endpoints for dashboards, monitoring, or analytics tools (e.g., Grafana). |
| **Infrastructure** | Managed with **Docker Compose**, orchestrating MQTT, RabbitMQ, backend services, and database in a reproducible environment. |
